# Ethereum's Deflationary Model: Mining and Earning Opportunities

The Ethereum network has undergone significant transformations in recent years, particularly with the transition from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS). This shift is central to Ethereum's deflationary model, which aims to reduce the circulating supply of ETH over time, potentially increasing its value. As part of this new model, validators who stake their ETH earn rewards while also securing the network.

One of the key terms associated with Ethereum mining is "gas fees," which users pay for transactions and smart contract executions. With the move to PoS, gas fees now play a crucial role in maintaining network security and compensating validators. Another important keyword is "stake slashing," which refers to penalties imposed on validators who act maliciously or fail to fulfill their duties.

While traditional mining using powerful GPUs is no longer feasible under the PoS system, opportunities still exist for earning through staking pools or delegating stakes. These platforms allow participants to combine resources and share rewards more efficiently. Additionally, decentralized finance (DeFi) applications built on Ethereum offer innovative ways to generate yield by leveraging various financial instruments.

Investors should be aware that staking involves locking up funds for extended periods, which may limit liquidity. However, the potential for consistent returns makes it an attractive option for those looking to participate in Ethereum's evolving ecosystem. By understanding these dynamics, users can make informed decisions about how best to engage with Ethereum's deflationary model and capitalize on emerging opportunities within the crypto space.
